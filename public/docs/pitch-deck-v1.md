# AgentScore Pitch Deck
## Bittensor Subnet Ideathon 2026

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**AgentScore: Credit Ratings for the Agent Economy**

*When machines spend money, trust can't be a feature. It has to be the foundation.*

**Bittensor Subnet Ideathon 2026**

### Speaker Notes
Welcome. We're AgentScore, and we're building the missing trust layer for agentic commerce. Think of us as the credit rating agency for AI agents, and we're here to present a Bittensor subnet that solves a critical infrastructure gap in the rapidly emerging agent economy.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Agents Are Spending Money Blind**

- AI agents now autonomously transact billions in services, APIs, and compute
- No standardized quality or trust layer exists to verify agent service providers
- Buyers cannot distinguish reliable endpoints from unreliable ones
- Fraud, downtime, and quality failures cost the agent economy millions daily
- Reputation systems are fragmented, gamed, or controlled by single vendors

### Speaker Notes
Here's the problem in simple terms: AI agents are making real money decisions, but they have no way to know if a service is reliable before they pay. Current solutions are either centralized, easily manipulated, or don't exist at all. When a Stripe agent calls an API, there's no neutral authority telling it whether that endpoint is trustworthy.

---

## Slide 3: Market Timing

**The Rails Are Built. Intelligence Isn't.**

- x402 (Coinbase): $402M+ in agent payments infrastructure launched Q4 2025
- AP2 (Google): Agent Protocol 2.0 standardizes agent-to-agent communication
- ACP (Stripe): Agent Commerce Protocol enables autonomous payments
- Visa TAP: Transaction Authorization Protocol for agent payments live now
- ERC-8004: Ethereum standard for agent service agreements ratified

### Speaker Notes
The market timing is perfect. In the past six months, every major player has launched infrastructure for agent payments. The rails exist, but the intelligence layer does not. We are the first to address the trust and quality verification gap that all these protocols desperately need. This is a classic infrastructure inversion.

## Slide 4: The Solution

**AgentScore: Real-Time Quality Ratings API**

- Decentralized quality intelligence for agent commerce endpoints
- Real-time ratings based on actual transaction outcomes, not marketing claims
- Simple REST API: query any endpoint and receive a trust score
- Coverage across compute, APIs, agent services, and payment processors
- Plug-and-play integration with x402, AP2, ACP, and Visa TAP

### Speaker Notes
AgentScore is the credit rating agency for the AI economy. We provide real-time, objective quality ratings that any agent can query before committing funds. Our ratings aren't based on surveys or vendor promises. They're based on ground truth from thousands of real micro-transactions happening continuously across the network.

---

## Slide 5: How It Works

**Predict-Then-Measure Architecture**

- Miners predict quality metrics for endpoints: uptime, latency, accuracy, cost integrity
- Validators execute real micro-transactions to verify predictions via commit-reveal
- Scores update continuously based on prediction accuracy and ground truth
- Commit-reveal prevents gaming: predictions locked before measurement occurs
- Architecture inspired by Taoshi SN8 but applied to service quality, not financial markets

### Speaker Notes
Here's our technical innovation. Like Taoshi's subnet uses miners to predict financial markets and validators to verify with real trades, we use miners to predict service quality and validators to verify with real transactions. Miners stake TAO, predict metrics, then validators actually call these endpoints and measure results. Wrong predictions lose stake. Right predictions earn rewards.

## Slide 6: Why Bittensor

**Decentralized Verification, Game-Theory Incentives**

- Yuma Consensus ensures fair reward distribution based on actual contribution
- Decentralized network cannot be gamed by a single vendor or competitor
- No central authority controls ratings, preventing manipulation or censorship
- Cryptoeconomic security: attacking the network costs more than the potential gain
- Native incentive alignment with TAO rewards driving continuous improvement

### Speaker Notes
Why Bittensor? Because centralized rating systems always get captured. A vendor could buy the rating company, or competitors could spam fake reviews. Bittensor's Yuma Consensus makes this economically irrational. To game our network, you'd need to control enough TAO to attack the consensus itself, which costs far more than any single rating is worth.

## Slide 7: Go-To-Market

**Inherently Viral Distribution**

- **Phase 1:** Public leaderboard rating other Bittensor subnets, creating natural visibility within our target market
- **Phase 2:** Free ratings API tier for developers with paid premium features
- **Phase 3:** Enterprise subscriptions for financial institutions and payment processors
- Partner integrations with x402, ACP, and Visa TAP as default trust provider
- Developer SDK for one-line integration into agent frameworks

### Speaker Notes
Our go-to-market is designed to be viral from day one. By rating Bittensor subnets first, we create immediate value for our exact target audience. Every subnet wants to know how they rank. That drives organic adoption. From there, we expand to the broader agent economy through API tiers and enterprise partnerships.

---

## Slide 8: Revenue Model

**Multiple Revenue Streams Aligned with Network Growth**

- **API Queries:** Per-call pricing for real-time ratings, volume discounts for high-usage clients
- **Enterprise Subscriptions:** Custom integrations, SLA guarantees, dedicated support
- **Verified Routing Proxy:** 0.5% to 2% transaction fee for routing payments through trusted endpoints
- **Premium Badges:** Verified quality certifications that service providers display
- **Data Licensing:** Historical quality data for analytics, research, and risk modeling

### Speaker Notes
We have five revenue streams that scale with the agent economy. API calls generate immediate revenue. Enterprise subscriptions provide predictable recurring income. Our routing proxy captures value from the transactions we enable. Premium badges let vendors monetize their quality scores. And our dataset becomes increasingly valuable as the definitive record of agent service quality.

---

## Slide 9: Competitive Advantage

**First Mover with Structural Moats**

- First dedicated quality intelligence layer for agent commerce
- Objective ground truth via real transactions, not subjective reviews or self-reporting
- Network effects: more endpoints rated attracts more users, which attracts more miners
- Data moat: historical quality data becomes increasingly valuable and harder to replicate
- Bittensor integration provides uncensorable, incentive-aligned infrastructure

### Speaker Notes
Our competitive advantages compound over time. Being first matters, but being first with real transaction data matters more. Every endpoint we rate adds to a dataset no competitor can replicate without years of operation. Network effects mean our lead widens as we grow. And Bittensor alignment means our infrastructure cannot be captured by any single actor.

## Slide 10: The Ask

**Selected for Bittensor Ideathon 2026**

- Building toward testnet launch in Q2 2026
- Seeking subnet registration and early validator participation
- Recruiting miners with expertise in service quality prediction
- Partnership discussions open with payment rails and agent frameworks
- **Visit agentscore.ai to learn more and join the network**

### Speaker Notes
We're here because we've been selected for the Bittensor Ideathon, and we're building toward testnet. We need validators to run verification nodes, miners to provide predictions, and partners to integrate our ratings into their agent frameworks. The agent economy is emerging now. Trust can't wait. Visit agentscore.ai to build the foundation with us.
