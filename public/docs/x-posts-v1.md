# AgentScore X/Twitter Content Plan
## 25 Posts for Launch and Early Growth

---

## 1. Launch/Announcement Posts (4)

**Post 1.1**
> AgentScore is live. Decentralized quality intelligence for the agentic economy. Every transaction leaves a signal. We measure them. #Bittensor #AgenticCommerce

*Timing: Launch day, pinned tweet. Establishes core identity immediately.*

---

**Post 1.2**
> The first credit layer for AI agents. Not a wallet. Not a marketplace. A protocol for verifying quality at scale. Built on @bittensor. 

*Timing: Day 2-3 of launch. Clarifies positioning, avoids being mistaken for infrastructure plays.*

---

**Post 1.3**
> Agents will spend more than humans by 2028. But who vouches for the seller? AgentScore: prediction markets + onchain verification for every agent transaction. 

*Timing: Week 1. Ties launch to macro thesis, creates urgency.*

---

**Post 1.4**
> Subnet 54. Predict. Measure. Verify. The three-step loop that lets agents transact with confidence. Not hype, just math. #Bittensor

*Timing: Week 1-2. Technical credibility post, references subnet number for discoverability.*

---

## 2. Problem Awareness Posts (5)

**Post 2.1**
> Right now an AI agent can spend your money on anything, with no way to verify quality beforehand. We are building the missing layer.

*Timing: Week 1. States the problem plainly, creates unease about current state.*

---

**Post 2.2**
> Humans have reviews, ratings, and reputation. Agents have APIs and hope. The gap is obvious. The fix is AgentScore.

*Timing: Week 2. Simple contrast that resonates, strong shareable hook.*

---

**Post 2.3**
> 10,000 agents launched this year. How many checked if the counterparty delivers before paying? The answer is uncomfortable.

*Timing: Week 2-3. Uses specific number for credibility, creates cognitive dissonance.*

---

**Post 2.4**
> Every agent payment today is essentially blind. No reputation history. No quality signal. Just a wallet address and a prayer. 

*Timing: Week 3. Stark framing of current risk, sets up solution later.*

---

**Post 2.5**
> The agent economy cannot scale without trust infrastructure. Not marketing trust. Verifiable, onchain, programmatic trust.

*Timing: Week 3-4. Bridges problem to solution category, elevates conversation.*

---

## 3. Market Context Posts (5)

**Post 3.1**
> x402 turns every API into a payment endpoint. Now imagine every endpoint with a quality score attached. That is the layer we are building.

*Timing: Post when x402 news breaks or in conversation with their launches. Complementary positioning.*

---

**Post 3.2**
> Major players are launching agentic wallets. Wallets need something to verify against. AgentScore is that verification layer.

*Timing: When Coinbase, Stripe, Google, or Visa announces agent wallet products. Non-confrontational framing.*

---

**Post 3.3**
> Wallets are the interface. Settlement is the rails. Quality intelligence is the missing layer. Three legs of a stool. We are the third.

*Timing: Week 2-4. Positions alongside major announcements without naming competitors.*

---

**Post 3.4**
> Everyone is building ways for agents to pay. Nobody was building ways for agents to know who to pay. Until now. #AgenticCommerce

*Timing: Week 2-3. Sharp contrast, establishes first-mover perception in our niche.*

---

**Post 3.5**
> The infrastructure stack is forming: wallets, settlement protocols, agent frameworks. Quality verification sits above all of them. That is us.

*Timing: Week 3-4. Positions in the emerging stack, creates category ownership.*

---

## 4. Technical Insight Posts (4)

**Post 4.1**
> Predict-then-measure. Agents stake predictions on transaction outcomes. Reality settles the score. Truth emerges from economic skin in the game.

*Timing: Week 2. Explains mechanism simply, uses "skin in the game" for credibility.*

---

**Post 4.2**
> Why Bittensor? Decentralized consensus on subjective quality. No single oracle. No centralized rating agency. Just incentives aligned toward truth.

*Timing: Week 2-3. Answers platform question before it is asked, appeals to decentralization ethos.*

---

**Post 4.3**
> Centralized ratings can be gamed. Decentralized verification is harder. Economic stakes make it harder still. That is why we built it this way.

*Timing: Week 3. Addresses trust concerns, explains design philosophy.*

---

**Post 4.4**
> Every prediction on AgentScore is a bet. Every measurement is a settlement. The market discovers quality the same way it discovers price.

*Timing: Week 3-4. Elegant mechanism description, appeals to crypto-native audience.*

---

## 5. Vision/Thought Leadership Posts (5)

**Post 5.1**
> The agent economy will be larger than the human economy. But only if agents can trust each other. Infrastructure first, abundance second.

*Timing: Week 2. Big vision framing, shows we are thinking long-term.*

---

**Post 5.2**
> We are not building for today. We are building for when a million agents negotiate, contract, and settle without human involvement. That future needs rails.

*Timing: Week 3. Time horizon expansion, infrastructure narrative.*

---

**Post 5.3**
> Credit agencies emerged because commerce needed trust at scale. AgentScore is the same evolution, but for autonomous systems. History repeats, protocol-first.

*Timing: Week 3-4. Historical analogy lends legitimacy, positions as inevitable.*

---

**Post 5.4**
> Invisible infrastructure wins. You do not think about TCP/IP when you browse. Soon you will not think about quality verification when agents transact.

*Timing: Week 4. Infrastructure humility, shows ambition without arrogance.*

---

**Post 5.5**
> The best agent experiences will feel like magic. Behind the magic: verification, reputation, and economic guarantees. That is the world we are building. 

*Timing: Week 4. Ends on aspirational note, connects technical work to user outcome.*

---

## 6. Community/Engagement Posts (4)

**Post 6.1**

*Timing: Week 1-2. Low-friction engagement, surfaces user concerns, good reply thread potential.*

---

**Post 6.2**
> Poll: What matters most before an agent pays a new counterparty?
A) Past transaction history
B) Third-party verification
C) Staked collateral
D) All of the above

*Timing: Week 2. Validates product assumptions, drives engagement, educational.*

---

**Post 6.3**
> If you are building agent infrastructure, DM us. Quality verification should not be siloed. We are designing for interoperability from day one.

*Timing: Week 2-3. Business development hook, signals openness, builds pipeline.*

---

**Post 6.4**
> One prediction: In 12 months, every serious agent will check a quality score before spending. Agree or disagree? Tell us why. 

*Timing: Week 3-4. Takes a stance, invites debate, creates engagement loop.*

---

## Usage Notes

**Posting Cadence:** 3-4 posts per week, mixing categories. Do not post consecutive problem awareness posts (too heavy). Mix vision and technical posts for balance.

**Engagement Strategy:** Reply to mentions within 2 hours during business hours. Quote tweet relevant infrastructure announcements with Posts 3.x series.

**Hashtag Strategy:** #Bittensor for network discovery, #AgenticCommerce for category building. Do not use both in every post.

**Voice Checklist:**
- No exclamation marks
- No rocket, moon, or fire emojis
- One period per sentence, no em dashes
- If it sounds like marketing, rewrite it sharper
