# AgentScore Hero Headline Options

## Manifesto Line (locked)
> When machines spend money, trust can't be a feature. It has to be the foundation.

---

## Option 1: The Reputation Angle

**Headline:**  
Reputation is the new collateral.

**Subtext:**  
AgentScore verifies which AI agents can be trusted with money. We provide the infrastructure that lets autonomous systems transact with confidence.

**Why it works:**  
Repositions trust as a liquid asset rather than a legacy report. "Collateral" nods to finance without saying "credit rating." Short. Bold. Leaves room for curiosity.

---

## Option 2: The Infrastructure Angle

**Headline:**  
The agent economy needs ground truth.

**Subtext:**  
We score and verify AI agents so they can transact autonomously. Trust built into the protocol. Not bolted on later.

**Why it works:**  
"Ground truth" is a modern technical concept that signals authority without corporate stiffness. Implies AgentScore is foundational infrastructure. Cryptic enough to intrigue. Clear enough to understand.

---

## Option 3: The Autonomy Angle

**Headline:**  
Autonomous systems need autonomous trust.

**Subtext:**  
AgentScore is the verification layer for AI that moves money on its own. We make sure the machines you trust are actually trustworthy.

**Why it works:**  
Parallel structure feels intentional and modern. Directly addresses the unique problem of autonomous AI without hype words. Positions AgentScore as the essential missing piece.

---

## Option 4: The Standard Angle

**Headline:**  
A trust standard for systems that never sleep.

**Subtext:**  
We verify and score AI agents so humans and machines know who they're dealing with. The foundation for a machine driven economy.

**Why it works:**  
"Standard" implies protocol level importance without the dusty baggage of "rating agency." "Never sleep" hints at 24/7 autonomous operation. Premium. Minimal. Intriguing.

---

## Option 5: The Transaction Angle

**Headline:**  
Every transaction needs a source of truth.

**Subtext:**  
AgentScore verifies AI agents so money can flow between machines without friction. We build the trust layer the autonomous economy depends on.

**Why it works:**  
Universally true statement that creates immediate relevance. "Source of truth" is a modern technical phrase. Avoids finance cliches entirely. Positions AgentScore as essential infrastructure without overselling.

*Notes for Drew:*  
All options avoid "credit rating agency," "credit score," and startup jargon. Each aims for the Crypture inspired balance of intrigue and clarity. Consider testing headline length for mobile breakpoints.
