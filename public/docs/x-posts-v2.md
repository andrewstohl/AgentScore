## 30 Posts for Launch and Early Growth

## 1. Launch/Announcement Posts (4)

**Post 1.1**
> AgentScore is live. Decentralized quality intelligence for the agentic economy. We read the signals others miss. (96 chars)

---

**Post 1.2**
> The first credit layer for AI agents. Not a wallet. Not a marketplace. A protocol for verifying quality at scale. Built on @bittensor. (125 chars)

---

**Post 1.3**
> Agents will outspend humans by 2028. But who vouches for the seller? Prediction markets plus onchain verification. That is the layer we are building. (130 chars)

---

**Post 1.4**
> Predict. Measure. Verify. The three-step loop that lets agents transact with confidence. Not hype, just math. #Bittensor (99 chars)

---

## 2. Problem Awareness Posts (5)

**Post 2.1**
> An AI agent can spend your money with zero verification of what it is buying. The blind payment problem is real. We are fixing it. (111 chars)

---

**Post 2.2**
> Humans have reviews. Agents have APIs and hope. The gap is obvious. (66 chars)

---

**Post 2.3**
> 10,000 agents launched this year. How many verified the counterparty before paying? The answer should worry you. (101 chars)

---

**Post 2.4**
> Every agent payment today is essentially blind. No reputation history. No quality signal. Just a wallet address and a prayer. (104 chars)

---

**Post 2.5**
> The agent economy cannot scale on vibes. It needs verifiable trust. Onchain. Programmatic. Real. (83 chars)

---

## 3. Market Context Posts (5)

**Post 3.1**
> x402 turns every API into a payment endpoint. Now imagine every endpoint with a quality score attached. That is the layer we are building. (113 chars)

---

**Post 3.2**
> Everyone is launching agentic wallets. Wallets need something to verify against. AgentScore is that verification layer. (101 chars)

---

**Post 3.3**
> Wallets are the interface. Settlement is the rails. Quality intelligence is the missing layer. Three legs of a stool. We are the third. (105 chars)

---

**Post 3.4**
> Everyone is building ways for agents to pay. Nobody was building ways for agents to know who to pay. Until now. #AgenticCommerce (103 chars)

---

**Post 3.5**
> The infrastructure stack is forming: wallets, settlement protocols, agent frameworks. Quality verification sits above all of them. That is us. (107 chars)

---

## 4. Technical Insight Posts (4)

**Post 4.1**
> Predict-then-measure. Agents stake predictions on transaction outcomes. Reality settles the score. Truth emerges from economic skin in the game. (108 chars)

---

**Post 4.2**
> Why Bittensor? Decentralized consensus on subjective quality. No single oracle. No centralized rating agency. Just incentives aligned toward truth. (110 chars)

---

**Post 4.3**
> Centralized ratings can be gamed. Decentralized verification is harder. Economic stakes make it harder still. That is why we built it this way. (106 chars)

---

**Post 4.4**
> Every prediction on AgentScore is a bet. Every measurement is a settlement. The market discovers quality the same way it discovers price. (102 chars)

---

## 5. Vision/Thought Leadership Posts (5)

**Post 5.1**
> The agent economy will be larger than the human economy. But only if agents can trust each other. Infrastructure first, abundance second. (104 chars)

---

**Post 5.2**
> We are not building for today. We are building for when a million agents negotiate, contract, and settle without human involvement. That future needs rails. (119 chars)

---

**Post 5.3**
> Credit agencies emerged because commerce needed trust at scale. AgentScore is the same evolution, but for autonomous systems. History repeats, protocol-first. (120 chars)

---

**Post 5.4**
> Invisible infrastructure wins. You do not think about TCP/IP when you browse. Soon you will not think about quality verification when agents transact. (109 chars)

---

**Post 5.5**
> The best agent experiences will feel like magic. Behind the magic: verification, reputation, and economic guarantees. That is the world we are building. (111 chars)

---

## 6. Community/Engagement Posts (4)

**Post 6.1**
> What is the riskiest thing you would let an AI agent purchase on your behalf right now? Reply with the category. Curious where the line is. (113 chars)

---

**Post 6.2 (Poll)**
> What matters most before an agent pays a new counterparty?
A) Transaction history
B) Third-party verification
C) Staked collateral
D) All of the above (147 chars)

---

**Post 6.3**
> If you are building agent infrastructure, DM us. Quality verification should not be siloed. We are designing for interoperability from day one. (111 chars)

---

**Post 6.4**
> One prediction: In 12 months, every serious agent will check a quality score before spending. Agree or disagree? Tell us why. (99 chars)

---

## 7. Behind the Build Posts (5)

**Post 7.1**
> Started AgentScore at an ideathon in 2024. The prompt was simple: what do agents need that does not exist yet? The answer was obvious. Trust infrastructure. (124 chars)

---

**Post 7.2**
> Spent months talking to agent builders. Same pattern: everyone focused on making agents smarter. Nobody on making them trust each other. Gap identified. (119 chars)

---

**Post 7.3**
> Built the first version in six weeks. Threw most of it out. The mechanism was right but the UX was wrong. Rebuilds are underrated. (103 chars)

---

**Post 7.4**
> Hardest part of building AgentScore: explaining why decentralized verification matters. It is not about ideology. It is about game theory. (107 chars)

---

**Post 7.5**
> Lesson from the build: simple mechanisms beat complex ones. Predict. Measure. Verify. Three words. One loop. That is the whole system. (98 chars)

## Usage Notes

**Posting Cadence:** 3-4 posts per week, mixing categories. Do not post consecutive problem awareness posts (too heavy). Mix vision and technical posts for balance.

**Engagement Strategy:** Reply to mentions within 2 hours during business hours. Quote tweet relevant infrastructure announcements with Posts 3.x series.

**Hashtag Strategy:** #Bittensor for network discovery, #AgenticCommerce for category building. Do not use both in every post.

**Voice Checklist:**
- No exclamation marks
- No rocket, moon, or fire emojis
- One period per sentence, no em dashes
- If it sounds like marketing, rewrite it sharper
