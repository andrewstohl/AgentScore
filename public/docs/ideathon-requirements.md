# Bittensor Subnet Ideathon — Requirements

## Timeline
- Round I: Dec 23, 2025 - Feb 28, 2026
- 7 teams selected, announced March 2
- Round II (Hackathon/Testnet): Mar 2 - Mar 30, 2026

## Submission Requirements

### 1. Subnet Design Proposal (PDF/Slides/Notion/GitHub)
- **Incentive & Mechanism Design**
  - Emission and reward logic
  - Incentive alignment for miners and validators
  - Mechanisms to discourage low-quality or adversarial behavior
  - How it qualifies as "proof of intelligence" or "proof of effort"
  - High-level algorithm: task assignment, submission, validation, scoring, reward allocation

- **Miner Design**
  - Miner tasks
  - Expected input → output format
  - Performance dimensions (quality, speed, accuracy)

- **Validator Design**
  - Scoring and evaluation methodology
  - Evaluation cadence
  - Validator incentive alignment

- **Business Logic & Market Rationale**
  - Problem and why it matters
  - Competing solutions (within and outside Bittensor)

  - Plausible path to long-term adoption and sustainable business

- **Go-To-Market Strategy**
  - Initial target users & use cases
  - Distribution & growth channels
  - Incentives for early participation (bootstrapping miners, validators, users)

### 2. Explanation Video (5-10 min)
- Walkthrough of architecture, mechanism design, and flows

### 3. Public Introduction Post (X/Twitter or other)

### 4. Pitch Deck (10 pages)

⚠️ No testnet/mainnet deployment required for Round I.
