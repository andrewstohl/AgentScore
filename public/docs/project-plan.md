## Sprint Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Feb 12-14) — CURRENT
- [x] Read all existing docs
- [x] Analyze ideathon requirements and judging criteria
- [x] Establish agent team structure
- [ ] Lead Analyst: Bittensor + agentic commerce + ideathon research brief
- [ ] Developer: Landing page v1 live on Vercel
- [ ] Doug: Master project plan ← THIS
- [ ] Doug: Restructured proposal outline (mapped to judging criteria)

### Phase 2: Core Content (Feb 15-18)
- [ ] Proposal first draft (complete, submission-ready structure)
- [ ] Narrative/messaging locked (one-liner, key talking points, positioning)
- [ ] Brand identity locked (colors, logo direction, tone)
- [ ] Marketing agent: Begin social content planning
- [ ] Developer: Landing page v2 with real content

### Phase 3: Deck + Video (Feb 19-21)
- [ ] Pitch deck first draft (10 slides)
- [ ] Video script first draft
- [ ] Proposal second draft (incorporating research + feedback)
- [ ] Drew: Review all drafts, provide feedback

### Phase 4: Polish + Ship (Feb 22-25)
- [ ] Feb 22: Proposal finalized → export to PDF
- [ ] Feb 23: Pitch deck finalized
- [ ] Feb 24: Video recorded + edited, X post published
- [ ] Feb 25: Submit everything on HackQuest

## Judging Criteria (What We Optimize For)

1. **Novelty and originality of incentive/scoring/coordination design**
   → Predict-then-measure for service quality (Taoshi parallel). Blind challenge mechanism. Anti-gaming suite.

2. **Clarity and soundness of mechanism logic**
   → Complete scoring function spec. Worked example. Clear miner/validator flows.

3. **Insightfulness and potential impact on future subnet design**
   → First subnet to rate other subnets. Ecosystem composability. Trust layer as infrastructure.

---

## Proposal Structure (Mapped to Requirements)

### Required sections per HackQuest:

1. **Incentive & Mechanism Design**
   - Emission and reward logic → Yuma Consensus + epoch-based scoring
   - Incentive alignment → miners compete on prediction accuracy, validators earn for honest verification
   - Anti-gaming → independence scoring, commit-reveal, consistency penalties, novelty bonus
   - Proof of intelligence → predictive modeling under adversarial conditions (not just measurement)
   - Algorithm overview → task assignment, submission, validation, scoring, reward allocation

2. **Miner Design**
   - Tasks → continuous probing + predictive model building + ATS scorecard submission
   - Input/output → endpoint observations → structured ATS predictions
   - Performance dimensions → prediction accuracy, fraud detection, novelty, consistency

3. **Validator Design**
   - Scoring methodology → blind challenge, commit-reveal, multi-validator overlap
   - Evaluation cadence → per epoch (72 min)
   - Validator incentives → cross-validator consistency checks

4. **Business Logic & Market Rationale**
   - Problem → trust gap in agentic commerce
   - Competition → Coinbase (biased), Chainlink (different domain), Datadog (provider-side)
   - Why Bittensor → neutrality, proven incentive mechanism, composability
   - Sustainable business → 5-layer revenue model, self-funding from emissions

5. **Go-To-Market Strategy** ← NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN
   - Initial users → Bittensor subnet APIs (Chutes, Synth), existing REST APIs
   - Distribution → one-line SDK integration, MCP server, "rating other subnets" virality
   - Early participation → miner bounties, alpha token airdrops to rated subnet stakers

## Key Risks to Track

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| No technical co-founder for Round 2 | Drew has candidate in mind — needs to confirm | Drew |
| No social presence for X post | Build account + following in next 10 days | Marketing agent |
| Proposal too long / too internal | Restructure around judging criteria, cut business analysis | Doug |
| Cold-start problem not addressed | Phase 1 targets broad API economy, not just x402 | Proposal |

---

## Drew's Action Items
- [ ] Connect Vercel to GitHub repo ✅ DONE
- [ ] Contact potential dev/technical co-founder
- [ ] Create X/Twitter account for AgentScore (or personal)
- [ ] Set up HackQuest account and team registration
- [ ] Review and provide brand preferences (colors, logo ideas)
